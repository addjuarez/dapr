## Fixes Mqtt pubsub component failure to read messages on startup when multiple subscriptions are configured
 
### Problem
 
When using the Mqtt component users who had multiple subcriptions could encounter an issue where messages would stop being processed for the component.
 
### Impact
 
This issue only occured for the Mqtt pubsub component and only occured in a specific scenario.

The issue only occurs when there are two subscriptions and messages are only being published to the 1st topic and the subscriber gets killed after publishing a few messages. If the subscriber comes back online and there has been a few (>2) messages published already then it wil only deliver the 1st pending message and stop.
 
### Root cause
 
When dapr tries to subscribe to the 2nd topic, it will try to reset the subscription and call m.consumer.Disconnect where it would halt.
 
### Solution
 
We have updated the mqtt sdk version to v1.4.2 which has had fixes for the race condition in disconnecting.
